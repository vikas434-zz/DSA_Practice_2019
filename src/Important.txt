1. Whenever kth sorted list comes, use priority queue/heap. Easy to implement using comparator.

2. Maximum sum array - use Kadane's algorithmm

3. For overlapping problems - its good to sort them based on start index.

======================
Some important questions asked always

1. Design and write code for LRU cache. => Use LinkedHashMap.

2. Implement HashMap in Java :- Use fixed sized array and ListObject like linked list to be added based on the function.
